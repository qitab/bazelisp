the compilation image.
 Arguments:
  ARGS - all the arguments
  COMMAND - one of :core, :binary, or :compile
  DEPS - dependencies,
  LOAD - files to be loaded after dependencies.
  SRCS - sources for a binary core or for compilation,
  OUTS - the output files,
  BINDIR - the directory for the output files (for debug),
  WARNINGS - is a list of files that contain deferred warnings,
  HASHES - is a list of files with defined source hashes,
  COMPILATION-MODE - from bazel -c <compilation-mode>
  BLOCK-COMPILE - Whether to enable block compilation.
  BLOCK-COMPILE-SPECIFIED-ONLY - Whether to only combine top-level-forms into a block within
    explicit (START-BLOCK) and (END-BLOCK), otherwise considering each top-level-form individually.
    If not specified, all forms are combined into a single block.
  FORCE - if true, the compilation may run to completion even with errors.
  MAIN - the name of the main function for a binary,
  FEATURES - features to be set before reading sources,
  NOWARN - list of warnings to be muffled,
  PRECOMPILE-GENERICS - if non-nil, precompile-generics before saving core,
  SAVE-RUNTIME-OPTIONS - will save the runtime options for the C runtime.
  COVERAGE - if the results should be instrumented with coverage information.
  VERBOSE - Verbosity level from 0 to 3.
  INTERACTIVE - Whether to enable interactive debugging."
